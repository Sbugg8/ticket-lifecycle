 When determining the Assignment, the system uses a process of assigning a support ticket to a specific team member or department who will handle it. When a ticket is created, the system can automatically or manually assign it to a staff member based on factors like ticket type, urgency, or available staff. Assigning tickets helps ensure that the right person is working on the right issue, making the support process more organized and efficient. In the picture below, the SLA has not been assigned yet but the issue summary helps determine which depatment should handle the ticket inquiry.

Communication is crucial in ticket management as it ensures smooth interaction between support agents and customers. osTicket offers multiple communication tools to keep users informed and engaged. Communication is vital in this environtment as it is designed to help offer a smooth collaboration and overall faster resolution. Some ways that agents communicate, can be through Email Notifications that consit of automated email alerts for new tickets, responses, status updates, and ticket closures, which keeps both customers and agents informed in real-time. Internal Notes, which agents can add private notes to tickets for internal discussions, as well as assisting in collaboration between multiple agents without notifying the customer. There are also Ticket Threads that helps maintain a clear history of interactions within the ticket for reference as well as Customer Portal Messages which the customer can log in to and check the update on the issued ticket as well as any important responses/feedback from the agent.

Once communication has been established inside of the agent userface of osTicjet, the agents can "Work" the issue. Working the issue refers to the process an agent or support team follows to investigate, troubleshoot, and resolve a ticket after it has been assigned. It includes all the actions taken to move the ticket toward resolution while maintaining communication with the customer and internal teams. This step is important because it ensures a structured approach to ticket resolution, enhances customer satisfaction with timely updates and improves efficiency by tracking progress systematically.

The Resolution stage refers to the process of successfully addressing and solving a customerâ€™s issue, leading to the closure of a support ticket. It signifies the final stage in the ticket lifecycle, ensuring that the reported problem is fixed and the customer is satisfied and is the last step taken before a ticket is closed out. Once a ticket is deemed "resolved", the end customer is ensured that all previous steps has been thoroughly completed to resolve the ticket matter.
